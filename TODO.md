# TODO
- Apply changes to a program when changing program from the UI. Need to check the actual behavior in J-Edit. FTM, just use the Store button on the J-Station.
- The following items in the program list's contextual menu : store and reload a program, export and import a program, copy / paste.
- Global parameters (digital output level, MIDI merge, ...) These parameters are loaded during initialization, I only need to build a UI component for them.
- Scale widgets display raw values. Actual units should be displayed instead (such as dB, ms, etc.)
- Scale widgets will not get to their full range. I'm working on this.
- Factory banks are selectable from the J-Station, but will not be reflected in the UI. I don't remember how this works in J-Edit.
