- Apply changes to a program when changing program from the UI. For the momeent,
just use the Store button on the J-Station.
- The following items in the program list's contextual menu: store and reload a
program, export and import a program, copy / paste, rename.
- Scale widgets display raw values. Actual units should be displayed instead
(such as dB, ms, etc.)
- Scale widgets will not get to their full range.
- Factory banks are selectable from the J-Station, but will not be reflected
in the UI.
